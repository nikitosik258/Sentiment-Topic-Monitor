The intense sadness of ""Prisoners of Fate"" (which means all the more if you've played the game) and the hope in ""A Distant Promise"" and ""Girl who Stole the Star"" have been an important inspiration to me personally throughout my teen years. The higher energy tracks like ""Chrono Cross ~ Time's Scar~"", ""Time of the Dreamwatch"", and ""Chronomantique"" (indefinably remeniscent of Chrono Trigger) are all absolutely superb as well.This soundtrack is amazing music, probably the best of this composer's work (I haven't heard the Xenogears soundtrack, so I can't say for sure), and even if you've never played the game, it would be worth twice the price to buy it.I wish I could give it 6 stars.",amaz soundtrack favorit music time hand intens sad prison fate mean youv play game hope distant promis girl stole star import inspir person throughout teen year higher energi track like chrono cross time scar time dreamwatch chronomantiqu indefin remenisc chrono trigger absolut superb wellthi soundtrack amaz music probabl best compos work havent heard xenogear soundtrack cant say sure even youv never play game would worth twice price buy iti wish could give 6 star,0.9998,55

It has everything for every listener -- from fast-paced and energetic (Dancing the Tokage or Termina Home), to slower and more haunting (Dragon God), to purely beautifully composed (Time's Scar), to even some fantastic vocals (Radical Dreamers).This is one of the best videogame soundtracks out there, and surely Mitsuda's best ever. ^_^",absolut masterpiec quit sure actual take time read play game least heard least track whether awar mitsuda music contribut great mood everi singl minut whole gamecompos 3 cds quit song havent exact count heartrend impress remark soundtrack one assur forget everyth everi listen fastpac energet danc tokag termina home slower haunt dragon god pure beauti compos time scar even fantast vocal radic dreamersthi one best videogam soundtrack sure mitsuda best ever,0.9999,-1

The music, BTW, is a combination of pop Renaissance and pop modern; anything but 18th century. The director appears to have had the goal of showing that his company was just too hip and too modern to do anything but make fun of this silly, fusty old play.I like ""The School for Scandal"" very much, and not having found any other DVDs of it, I started out with the intention of keeping a recording of even a bad production.

negative,"MASK OF FAMILIARITY: MASK MAKER takes us down a cinematic path often traveled and does it in a typically predictable fashion. A story of revenge with an unstoppable killer who murders his victims and uses their skinned faces to achieve some kind of beauty. Flashbacks reveal his motivation in an attempt to elicit some level of sympathy.MASK MAKER isn't the worst entry in this familiar territory but it doesn't tread new waters either. The cast performs on various levels of competence. WEEKEND AT BERNIE's Terry Kiser is an effective guilt-ridden buffoon. Treat Williams is ill-used in a cameo role. Horror vet Michael Berryman is unusually restrained in a small role. Nikki Deloach is no Jamie Lee Curtis in her leading role, giving a weak performance in a typical survivor role as the resilient resourceful female.

negative,"Unmasked..................: Sadly, there is absolutely nothing original in this movie. The filmmakers shamelessly borrowed from practically everyone, turning out a stale formula piece that is purely by the numbers. I couldn't find a thing that elevated this movie above a 100 other like films. The plot is standard: a group of kids spend the weekend at an old house with a bad history. A standard, run of the mill maniac kills them in unimaginative ways and of course no one notices until it's too late. Everything happens exactly on cue, in order, with no surprises, and no frights. This movie is safe and boring, it really couldn't have been any better if it tried. Not even the brief appearance of horror icon Michael Berryman (playing a nice guy for a change) can help the dullness of the script.Even the title is a misnomer!

It showed some of the difficulties couples might face after marriage.

I believe that once a family member has married someone, the rest of the family should be respectful and supportive of that choice and welcome and love the new spouse.

The plot never fully explains itself. Is the book about figuring out how a dead criminal could commit crimes - or is it about Scarpetta - redeeming herself in the eyes of everyone around her - after developing an anti-social workaholic tendency after the death of a loved one? The latter seems to be the path the author choose - leaving some of the twist in the plot unresolved. Though others in the story have made Scarpetta out to be the villain (on many different levels - as a family member, as a friend and as a professional) in the end her `goodness' is redeemed.

It was occasionally funny, considering the title and cast of comedians, who played comedians. The last 45 minutes, the film changes pace entirely, as if it wasn't floundering enough, and drops its attempts at weak comedy to push even weaker drama.

Both protagonist and narrator, the cat often acts as a Greek chorus who comments, often sardonically, on the actions of the humans around him. Set in pre-World War II Algeria, with a lengthy detour to Paris, the beautifully illustrated narrative depicts a richly diverse world in which individuals seek to preserve their traditions while constantly interacting with people of other cultural, social and religious backgrounds. In this multilayered environment, the presence of an intelligent talking cat does not seem entirely out of place.",delight exot world seen cat eye rabbi cat french artist filmmak joann sfar whimsic charm fabl featur rabbi love daughter host charact head talk cat protagonist narrat cat often act greek chorus comment often sardon action human around set preworld war ii algeria lengthi detour pari beauti illustr narrat depict rich divers world individu seek preserv tradit constant interact peopl cultur social religi background multilay environ presenc intellig talk cat seem entir place,0.9997,-1
negative,"Self-Serving Message: This is the tale of a kindly Rabbi, his sweet daughter and the cat who loves her. The tale seems promising at first, until it delves into bitterness over God and those who love Him and follow His laws. The cat represents the glorification of sin itself, and delights whenever the book's characters fall into ungodly habits, judging them forever as hypocrites (taking no account into repentance and future avoidance of said sin). As is the case with most humanist literature the story down spirals from that point until it ends with the Rabbi losing faith in God. At this point the cat is truly happy with the Rabbi, thus giving the tale a 'happy ending'. In short, 'The Rabbi's Cat' is a tale structured to appeal to secular humanists, atheists and pagans who want to feel better about their self-serving, do as you feel, lifestyles.One more note: This book, despite the beautiful artwork and appealing cover, is definitely not appropriate for children.",selfserv messag tale kind rabbi sweet daughter cat love tale seem promis first delv bitter god love follow law cat repres glorif sin delight whenev book charact fall ungod habit judg forev hypocrit take account repent futur avoid said sin case humanist literatur stori spiral point end rabbi lose faith god point cat truli happi rabbi thus give tale happi end short rabbi cat tale structur appeal secular humanist atheist pagan want feel better selfserv feel lifestyleson note book despit beauti artwork appeal cover definit appropri children,0.679,-1

The boning is very supportive and higher quality then a bridal style corsette (most of those are cheap and just to get things to lay down more smoothly). I'm pleased with the product. One thing I will say on the negative side is that I'm rather short. These are more of a one-size fits all from what I understand and mine is a bit long in the torso since I'm 5'1"". Not an issue, it's meant that way so that it will cover under the chest down to about the belt so you dont have any random tire hanging over your pants, but I'm already fairly thin and this just causing the top wires to rub under my bra or jeans.

You cannot really wear it under thin clothing, as others have pointed out, and, for me, it is impossible to wear it during hot summer days - the sweating and the rubber can create a rash situation - but I still recommend the product.

However, I put it on today, and while my left side is all smooth and nicely held in, the support thing (bone or whatever) under my right breast seems to have lost all its firmness.

Otherwise, I would take it off.19 years later, after having my second child, I was looking for the same waist cincher which I just received and began working out with it.

negative,"IN THE TRASH IT GOES!!!!!: Hello! I am a woman nearing my 60s, and my waist certainly isn't getting any smaller! I purchased this product in the hopes that it would shrink my ever-growing belly. To accommodate for my girth, I bought the Squeem ""Magical"" Lingerie Shapewear in XXXXX-Large, the largest size available. WELL, here's a bit of magic for ya, sisters. The second I snapped the first two hooks together, the tightness was unbearable. It felt like it was squeezing my waist fat straight down to my giant ass. Fortunately, the discomfort didn't last long, since the hooks flew off and therefore ruined the Squeem altogether. These things need to come in larger sizes. Not even worthy of 1 star.

positive,Very sturdy: This item is very sturdy and holds in the belly area better than another softer belt I have. The measurements seem true to size and there are two rows of hooks so you can adjust if you lose some weight.The only negative points are that the item smells badly of rubber when new. It must be washed before wearing. The other is that all that rubber can make you sweat. But those are minor complaints if you want to look good for an evening. The belt also helps me sit straight so I think it's good for the back as well as the front.,sturdi item sturdi hold belli area better anoth softer belt measur seem true size two row hook adjust lose weightth negat point item smell bad rubber new must wash wear rubber make sweat minor complaint want look good even belt also help sit straight think good back well front,0.9196,-1

It fit snug in the beginning but after one week I had to go to the tighter hooks and even that is too big now and I may need to buy a small.

They are heavy and seemingly well made but they have been faulty in a a number of ways. First my biggest complaint is on the white plates everytime you happen to scrape them with silverware it leaves a permanent mark. Never wash anything stainless near them in the diawasher since it will mark it up there as well if it rubs up against them. After years of use they looked horrible with marks all over them. They also seemed to chip very easily. So between the chips and marks all over them I couldn't take looking at them anymore. They also are not good in the microwave. They get very hot and the food not so much. I would not recommend for everyday use. Maybe the dark colors would show less marks but if they chip it will be very noticable.

I will never buy these again.,dont order white light color owe plate white quit year mayb six replac set crate barrel heavi seem well made faulti number way first biggest complaint white plate everytim happen scrape silverwar leav perman mark never wash anyth stainless near diawash sinc mark well rub year use look horribl mark also seem chip easili chip mark couldnt take look anymor also good microwav get hot food much would recommend everyday use mayb dark color would show less mark chip notic advic purchas bone china porcelain never buy,0.999,103

Inevitable conclusion is the impossibility of molding an economic system out of a moral philosophy, not just Islam. That is where the problem with traditional Islamic thought arises, for most of its adherents, Islam is not just a set of moral principles but a way of life, dictating every aspect of it. Unavoidably, there was much effort by Islamists to set up a distinct system of banking and economy based on pure Islamic traditions. Prof. Kuran delves into the history of these movements, but he does more than that, he puts all this in cultural and political context. At the end, he bravely expands more on the general failure of Islamic culture and tradition to bring wealth and prosperity to the masses that follow it.

But the last three he has written, including this one, ""Edge of Danger"", are very disappointing. He has resorted to producing 2 books a year, based on the formula of a superficial story line with no depth, predictable characters, and it seems that he now writes just to capitalize on his prior reputation as a good suspense writer.Count the number of Marlboros smoked, the amount of Bushmills and champagne drank, (and in the midst he changes his champagne brand which makes one wonder whether he has received a better commission from one favorite to another), and you find a shallow book.

It was difficult to keep track of all the minor characters in the book because none of them were well developed. I will proabably never read another Jack Higgins book.

He lacks the courage to confess his crime and goes through a period of mental and physical torture. He also faces the wrath a cruel and vicious enemy who lives for nothing more than to torture his victim. All in all I believe it was an excellent book and I would reccomend it to anyone.,excel book read book 11th grade lit class must admit book quit shock mani book read noth attempt delv inner part human soul book much depict struggl man outsid enemi commit one unspeak act time punish constant lack courag confess crime goe period mental physic tortur also face wrath cruel vicious enemi live noth tortur victim believ excel book would reccomend anyon,0.9923,-1

It gets dragged out and is suppose to be realistic. Then he throws Pearl in there, she is like some super-human and belongs in fantasy. I never really did believe in the whole 'they completely ostracized her but let her stitch everything.' That is just a bit hypocritical, either she was excepted as prat of the society *which she was not) or she wasn't (which she almost was. See that just doesn't make any sense.

positive,"Gripping: This novel is an Opera, pure and simple.Granted it is not the easiest novel to read, and Hawthorne can be slightly repetitive with the metaphors, similes and analogies that sometimes go on for several lines. Not to mention you could probably read half of each chapter and still keep up with the plot.Nonetheless, the themes are so strong it is no wonder The Scarlett Letter has been deemed a classic. The story tackles the issues of how one deals with his/her sins, and how honesty, for some, comes at the price of great shame.The novel does take patience, but it moves along at a very neat pace. Had the novel been written with more scenes, and less exposition, it could have been even more gripping.I read the Reader's Digest edition, which comes with about 12 lovely illustrations, which capture the essence and the mood of the novel.

positive,"Good read, but hard to navigate ebook: I have long wanted to read this book by Nathaniel Hawthorne. It was one of the first books I downloaded when I got my kindle 2. The character portrayals are superb. It analyses the thoughts, motivations, strengths and weaknesses of the four major characters in the story - Hester Prynn, the vengeful doctor, the hapless minister and Hester's vivacious and elf-like daughter Pearl. The description of the little girl and how she copes with being ostracized with her mother by a rigid puritanical society, is especially moving. While there are some descriptions of nature that are quite vivid, most of the text goes into developing these four characters and is a fascinating psychological study, though at times it's little slow.Overall, a well-crafted story and a good read.The book though is hard to navigate on the kindle because it has no active table of contents.

Yes, it was heavily thematic and full of symbolism; and it was ""meaty"" (whatever that is), ""deep"", and ""powerful""; but it was dry, slow, and boring. Even someone as myself, who generally enjoys the classics, will fall asleep (as I did everytime I tried to read this book). Do NOT try to speed-read this.

negative,"Both forward and backward in its ideas: First of all: those who found the book to be dull, such as me, listen to it on tape (it's abbreviated yet still dangerous = boring to listen to while driving, as I found out). Indeed, Hawthorne introduces some advanced ideas for the times, such as writing about a single mother, as well as musings about women's rights. His obsession with Victorian themes, such as the deification of children, fixation on bodily sins, as well as overdramatization and simplification of the plot equals predictability and annoyance to the reader. While this book could probably be considered ""a classic,"" such as Tolstoy's ""Anna Karenina,"" both are better classified as carefully crafted literary exercises rather than engaging stories.",forward backward idea first found book dull listen tape abbrevi yet still danger bore listen drive found inde hawthorn introduc advanc idea time write singl mother well muse women right obsess victorian theme deific children fixat bodili sin well overdramat simplif plot equal predict annoy reader book could probabl consid classic tolstoy anna karenina better classifi care craft literari exercis rather engag stori,0.9762,411

Hawthorne explores when feelings and passion conflict with religion, which was fascinating to consider from a religious perspective.Although I did not enjoy the book much at the time I had to read it, it proved to be quite useful when I took the AP Literature and Composition Test this year.

positive,"Timeless Classic: I enjoyed this book a lot, once I got past the slow parts. Hester Prynne is found pregnant out of wedlock. Since she won't reveal the identity of the father, she is forced to wear the Scarlet Letter ""A"" on her chest for the rest of her life. She gives birth to a girl and she changes her life around, so at the end of the book, people refer to her as ""Angel"" instead of ""Adulterer.""This is a timeless tale because the situation could easily happen in any time period. When we do something wrong, the way we live our lives afterwards is the determining factor of our moral character. One event does not define us. It's our entire lives that should be taken into account. I think that is Nathaniel Hawthorne's point. Redemption is possible for anyone, regardless of their sin. Also, the father who remained unknown to the society but not the reader, suffers enormously because he doesn't confess. This is a good point.

Hawthorne spends so much time discussing the characters' thoughts and motives that by the end of the book, you can understand why the people act the way they do. It makes them seem almost real. He relates nature to what the character's are experiencing that makes the story even more powerful. In one place he told of a rose bush that grew by the prison so it seemed Nature was saying that even though other people had abandoned them, someone could always count on the nature's love. It's very beautifully written. The story of adultery and jealous spouses happens in our own day which makes The Scarlet Letter relate to the reader.

Only a handful artists such as Busta Rhymes, Queen Latifah, and Ice Cube have mastered the art of keeping with rap's evolution, and so far Nelly has. Overall, ""Hot in Here"" is a great summer anthem sure to keep anyone moving.

Indeed, the movie comes together with Linus quoting from sacred scripture after Charlie Brown asks in frustration what the true meaning of Christmas really is.If you are parent who wants an entertaining Christmas movie for your kids that doesn't attempt to gloss over the true meaning of Christmas by using gushy messages about peace on earth and family togetherness, but gets right to the point of Christ's birth, consider a Charlie Brown Christmas.

But it is *because* I love this show (and otherwise would give it five stars without hesitation) that I'm forced to give a one-star review of this particular 2008 remastered/deluxe version.

To me it's not a big loss, as the light on my Apple charger quit working 2 years ago.I've been using this charger on my 15"" aluminum PowerBook G4 for months, and it has performed exceptionally. The brick does get a little warm, but so does Apple's. I actually prefer this charger over Apple's when traveling, as its longer cord is more functional in airports and hotel rooms. The cord is about the same length as Apple's charger with the extension cord installed, except that it weighs less than half as much and takes up less room in a laptop bag or backpack.I love having an extra charging cable at home so I don't have to play the plug/unplug game every time I move my laptop between rooms.

negative,"Very disappointing: I ordered this new knife from Amazon based on the Laguiole name, prior Sabatier experience and the one review (5 stars). What a disappointment! One side of the blade had very visible tarnish and reddish blue spots (not sure whether rust or previously used). It also has a very light and extremely cheap look with poor manufacture. It is made in France, but it goes to show that junk comes out from there just as easy as from China, Pakistan or anywhere else. True you get what you pay for, but this one wouldn't be worth even 2 bucks at a yard sale. Maybe it was a defective unit, but I didn't want to take a chance with a replacement. I never even tried to use it, and simply returned it. To Amazon's credit, their return process was great.

Though she sought to understand the Amish way of life, she totally missed what it is all about. Maybe it was because the church service was in German or maybe she was so focused on herself that she could not see beyond to the fact that peace comes from a relationship with God. Her final line in the book stated that miracles take a lot of work. I would beg to disagree and say that God is the one who does miracles and therefore they take no work, just faith. This is what Sue Bender missed and is still missing I am afraid. We use Amish textbooks in our home education program, so the insights she shared were not really new to me.

negative,"An Unclear Biography of Napoleon: Napoleon is probably one of the most widely written about historical figures. There are many differing views about his intentions and ambitions. Markham takes a somewhat 'unclear' point of view when writting about the French Emperor. At times it seems like he is praising Napoleon for one thing or the other and at other times he is criticizing the ' Corsican Orge'. He laudes Napoleon's form of government as being advanced beyond its years yet he draws on unreliable memoirs which denounced Napoleon with impunity.

I actually think this book is very good for boys to read - it's about knights and fighting for one's honor, and demonstrating loyalty, but it's also about being able to cry when you need to, and being able to express love for others.In this story, the little boy's nanny is moving away, because he's growing up and doesn't need her, and he has some trouble accepting this. I think it's a wonderful, simple way to address some of the issues all children face when approaching their teenage years.I definitely recommend this one to parents and children.",daughter son enjoy book over long written simpl enough languag 8 9 year old children troubl read itit engag sweet stori introduc concept chivalri braveri actual think book good boy read knight fight one honor demonstr loyalti also abl cri need abl express love othersin stori littl boy nanni move away hes grow doesnt need troubl accept think wonder simpl way address issu children face approach teenag yearsi definit recommend one parent children,0.9998,265

The directional control is a bit sensitive so be careful not to send Lara over the rail or short fence and have her fall to her demise. The graphics are a big imporovement from the previous versions and the animation is very smooth.

The band added a keyboard player Graham Maitland for this tour which at first is a bit hard to digest(mixed too far up front)sometimes the keyboards work, other times not. There are some classics here- 'The king will come', 'Persephone', 'Time Was' as well as a few others. Sound quality is average, sounds like a straight transfer with no doctoring with the sound. This is the Mark 2 lineup with Laurie Wisefield. Not one of the best concert offerings by the band but worthwhile.

positive,"Thrash Metal Survives: While most thrash/speed bands have watered-down their sound into something unrecognizable (Metallica) or begun to gravitate toward nu-metal (Slayer), there are a few that have retained their own identities, still playing the fast, brutal music that made them infamous to begin with. Sodom is one of those bands. The production from Harris Johns is top-notch and most of the songs are truly great, only a few descending into that mindless drum-pounding/guitar-shredding that can sometimes afflict bands that straddle the line between thrash and death or black metal.

In this game, mission by mission, you learn how to balance your troops and how to move in the territory. It's important the fact that troops can interact with territory (hills, woods). You can hide your troops, you can stay higher than the enemy and then attack you enemy suddenly (for example,if your bowmen are in a higher position they will hurt more seriously the enemy).

positive,"Enjoyable: Gerald and Hyacinth appeared to have a perfect marriage, blessed with two beautiful children. However, when cracks appeared (or were the cracks there all along?), there was no stopping the swift breakdown of the marriage and the bitterness that came with it. Gerald had the upper hand in the divorce as he successfully blackmailed Hyacinth into letting him have the custody of both children. Pressured by Gerald, but unable to divulge the secret behind his blackmail to anyone, only when the mystery surrounding the fateful night was solved would Hyacinth be able to get on with her life.The plot was gripping.

negative,"What was RITA thinking?: I was so disappointed in this book. Since it was the 1998 RITA award as best regency, and beat ""Lord Heartless"" for that win, I was expecting a terrific novel. Instead, the book drags and the characters act in such an unrealistic ways. As far as the Duke goes, our hero, he has no family or friends. The heroine, and I use that term lightly, plays at being a spinster and dressing as a drab. For some reason, delights in hiding her beauty. In the ballroom scene, she behaves in such a manner that loses me entirely - as well as any interest that she should end up with the Duke in the end. He deserved better! The dukes only friend betrays him. He is a miserable man who society now scornes when he did nothing wrong in the first place! He should have packed his bags and came to america.

The difficulties that many young women face as they mature into fully functioning sexual adults - as mitigated by their upbringings as well as the varied expectations of society and their partners - are nicely illustrated through a series of real life case studies. The author, Dr. Bardon, was a teaching and research member of the faculty of the University of Minnesota from the early 1960s through the late 1990s.

negative,"A padded short story disguised as a literary novel: The kindest description of this book would be that it is well-written and quite pointless. The plot is paper thin and all the characters (with the possible exception of Mr Hilditch) are either two dimensional or borrowed from other, more superior, works. The much-touted plot twist, when it finally arrives, lacks any irony and seems contrived. William Trevor is best known as a short story writer and this book is essentially a short story padded into a novel. As a well-written, mildly diverting, piece of light entertainment it would have been acceptable, as a prize-winning piece of high literary pretensions, it is not.

Beyond her frustration, we are never privy to any of her emotions. What did she think of her plight? Why did she never worry that Johnny, her lover, might reject her? I feel that the author made a mistake by never writing in Felicia's viewpoint during her scenes with Mr. Hilditch. We certainly know many of his feeling and thoughts concerning Felicia, but never, never any of her thoughts about her sinister friend. ...The character of Mr. Hilditch is very well developed, unfortunately more so than the main character.

The intimations of his unusual childhood merely suggest that he may be more disturbed than his manner presumes. Mr. Hilditch's interactions with strangers in the presence of Felicia provide the most chilling insight into the purpose of his friendship with her. It is for this reason alone that the film fails so miserably. No reference is made at all to these brief conversations. As for Felicia herself, it must be said that her character is a little limp.

negative,This toy is JUNK!: I ordered two of these for my kids. The pump for the rocket is made so you have to hold it while pumping but there is no good way to hold it securely while pumping. There is a trigger to lock in the rocket while pumping but the trigger is in the way of holding the pump and is unsafe because a simple bump makes the rocket launch accidentally. The piston in the pump is so cheap that it bends when you push it in. The end cap on the pump chamber is not properly secured to the pump. I tried the pumps that came with both rockets.

This book is more like the cliff notes to a book about men's fashion, tradition, style, etc. The other half of the book is relatively useless - unless, of course, you're a millionaire & world traveller. The prose is humorous at times becasue it's so pretentious - bordering on the effeminate a la Niles Crane. Still, there are some very imporatnt basice male fashion rules established by history and tradition, discussed in this book, which one wishes were adhered to more regularly. The first half of the book is serviceable, but not authoritative.

positive,"Unsurpassed in importance!: The first edition came out in 1998 and, six years on, this work has not been surpassed for its importance as an analysis of WWII joint warfighting, the Luftwaffe's way of war, airpower in the Crimea, airpower in the Caucasus, airpower at Stalingrad, and naturally the Stalingrad airlift itself.The reasons for this book's immediate ""classic"" status are easy to pick: totally accurate citing of hundreds of never-before-used sources in several languages drawn from major archives; a highly original approach to the writing of campaign histories; a clear argument; a fair and balanced approach; no Wehrmacht-devotee comments or tone (all too common I'm afraid); a wonderfully readable writing style; and precise footnotes that help the reader to determine the reliability of all claims or statements.A true model of a WWII campaign analysis.

""Stopped at Stalingrad"" is also a richly drawn study of the most important air campaigns in the Eastern Front. Written in an accessible style this volume will be welcomed by anyone with an interest in the WWII. I was very pleasantly surprised by the book and also the quality of its contents. The author did a masterful job of research. Joel Hayward draws on diaries of both key commanders and regular airmen. He also shows that the poorly conceived strategies of Hitler and his buffoon, Goering, dommed the efforts of men such von Manstein, Milch and Wolfram von Richthofen (an outstanding soldier) to come to grips with an impossible situation.

The reason I gave these DVDs 4 stars instead of 5, however, is because of the complete lack of extras on the first two movies. Also the amount of grain is higher in dark scenes in Spider-Man compared to the other 2 sequels (which have almost none).

Strictly speaking, a haiku must contain a ""season word"" and restrict itself to condensed, defined, natural imagery. Those are the outward rules, and they are rules which can be (and are) broken. It is in the inward force of a rich combination of Taoism, Buddhism and Shintoism that gives haiku it's power and grace. THE HAIKU YEAR, while an interesting experiment, is problematic in that much of it appears to imitate haiku and the powerful subtlety for which haiku is known is simply not there.

negative,"A Let-Down...: John Keel's ""Mothman Prophecies"" could be a great book if it actually concentrated on the ""Mothman"" sightings in and around Point Pleasant, West Virginia in the mid-to-late 1960's. Unfortunately, this book isn't really about the Mothman, but it should instead be entitled ""John Keel explains how the universe really works"". For every ""Mothman"" story that Keel relates in this book, he offers at least three other stories of his personal life, his adventures in researching the paranormal, and his decidedly offbeat theories about paranormal events and what causes them. This book isn't really about the ""Mothman"" sightings in West Virginia as much as it is a goofy memoir of John Keel's ""research"" into the world of UFOs, demons, ghosts, and other bizarre events.

This is par for the course in this genre, and puts this reviewer in mind of Charlie Brown's standard beginning for tales, ""It was a dark and stormy night.""Despite its rather disorganized and somewhat repetitive presentation (again, fairly standard for this genre), Keel relates his narrative earnestly, and he will engage your interest.

Central to this electronic beatfest is M.I.A's sassy vocals, falling somewhere in between Madonna and Lene Lovich (the Neneh Cherry comparison is pretty good) all within the framework of hip-hop rhyming. There's really no need to over-analyze the music, which is basically infectious stripped-down beats, eg, LCD Soundsystem, pulsating, raw and tribal, almost hailing back to the crushing barebones approach of early hip-hop, eg, Grandmaster Flash.

But basically the appeal of 'Arular' stems from the charm and sexuality of M.I.A's vocals, orgasmic shrieks and brassy chants, a female touch when one expects male vocals to compliment the rhythmic thunder.

positive,"Great Music, and A Lot of It, At A Great Price: This disc contains Ornette Coleman's pioneering 37-minute 'Free Jazz' PLUS 40 minutes of shorter pieces recorded in the same year. So for a little less money than the American release of 'Free Jazz' you get about twice as much music, and the title track is the final piece, a fitting climax to a great set of music. That said, the jazz on this disc may be more challenging than some listeners would like, but among the extended collective improvisations of the sixties, besides being the first, this one is more immediately accessible, because it SWINGS and it COOKS! And you can tell the musicians are actively listening to each other and responding to each other's work, not just showing off or venting their emotions. So in a nutshell, 'Free Jazz' is less cosmic than Sun Ra's 'Magic City', less cerebral than Cecil Taylor, and less primal than Coltrane's 'Ascension', but probably more likely to hook you into an intensely brilliant musical world.",great music lot great price disc contain ornett coleman pioneer 37minut free jazz plus 40 minut shorter piec record year littl less money american releas free jazz get twice much music titl track final piec fit climax great set music said jazz disc may challeng listen would like among extend collect improvis sixti besid first one immedi access swing cook tell musician activ listen respond other work show vent emot nutshel free jazz less cosmic sun ras magic citi less cerebr cecil taylor less primal coltran ascens probabl like hook intens brilliant music world,0.9982,8

negative,"Bit of a Letdown in the End: This is part of my attempt to read classics and non-fiction as well as my usual speculative fiction this year. A few people noted that Hardy is a bit of a hard read, and that turned out to be true. His style is jagged and choppy, bouncing around quite a bit, and never giving you a true glimpse of some scenes important to know how to interpret (such as the question of Tess' seduction or rape by Alec d'Urberville). However, overall, it is an interesting story at least and I enjoyed the book. But considering the ending seemed to be rather ill-fitting to the rest of the tale, I'll have to pass on giving it a high rating. It was rather disappointing to slog through his odd phrasings and quirks, only to be let down at the end by the characters just magically changing personality traits. I think Tess was a weakling without a mind of her own for the most part, Angel was worthless, and the character with the most potential in the story is the so-called villain, Alec d'Urberville.",bit letdown end part attempt read classic nonfict well usual specul fiction year peopl note hardi bit hard read turn true style jag choppi bounc around quit bit never give true glimps scene import know interpret question tess seduct rape alec durbervill howev overal interest stori least enjoy book consid end seem rather illfit rest tale ill pass give high rate rather disappoint slog odd phrase quirk let end charact magic chang person trait think tess weakl without mind part angel worthless charact potenti stori socal villain alec durbervill,0.9775,91
negative,"Most pathetic character in all of literature.: Tess of the D'Urbervilles is one of the worst books I have ever read. I read this book in high school, though I am now in college, but don't discount this review because of that. Tess has absolutely no backbone. She pines away for stupid Angel who is more cruel to her than the guy who raped her in many ways. I know women weren't as strong at that time but even so, she is still pathetic. When she tells Angel that she would jump in the river and kill herself for him, I laughed out loud! Tess is a spineless, pathetic excuse for a human being. She needs to take some lessons from Jane Eyre, a hundred times better heroine. Also, Hardy describes the same stupid valley so many times that the book drags on forever and seems like it is never going to end. I disliked all of the characters so much, that it made the book have not one redeeming quality to it.

What teachers should do is recommend books, not make students read them, it kills the interest in a book. This was a nice blend of tragic and weakness.

Finally, Tess is an admirable and strong woman who had difficult circumstances. How many people would act as admirably in her circumstance? Not many!

If you know Hardy, you immediately recall his superfluity of detail and monotonous landscaping, which inevitably impedes character and plot development. Suprisingly, though all discouraging factors were present, I found the book exceptionally appealing. Hardy's portraiture of Tess validates him as a captivating author. He draws us into her persona, leaving us trampled and bruised with the grievances of life. He walks us through her struggles, though mangled with her inability to step forward, she still persists.I highly reccommend this book to any avid reader of British literature.",daunt delight quirki yet brilliant english teacher assign work begin senior year undoubt approach book much doubt skeptic know hardi immedi recal superflu detail monoton landscap inevit imped charact plot develop supris though discourag factor present found book except appeal hardi portraitur tess valid captiv author draw us persona leav us trampl bruis grievanc life walk us struggl though mangl inabl step forward still persistsi high reccommend book avid reader british literatur,0.9994,242

Unfortunately, I was completely wrong. Tess depressed and frustrated me extremely throughout the book. She cowarded down and let people run over her.

Granted people's experiences differ from prefecture to prefecture and from school to school, but Learning to Bow's anecdotes and observations about Japan are far too extreme and at times border on lies.

Because of the latter he is no longer allowed to practice medicine and is forced to live on a farm in poverty. His love for the woman, too, has been put to the test, yet he sticks with her, even though it means returning to his country after being given exile in France.The themes are intelligent and interesting, but the development is too slow: the movie is much too long at nearly 3 hours. Scenes seemed to be dragged out interminably, especially those in Paris as he weighs his conscience regarding his love and his homeland, and near the end on the farm.

positive,"The best film nobody saw: The Unbearable Lightness of Being is a masterpiece, the most underrated American film of the past 30 years. Poetic, haunting, subtle, and terribly sad, it says more about the crushing impact of repressive (i.e. communist) regimes than a thousand documanteries or inflammatory speeches could tell. While idealizing the free-wheeling Prague of the late 60's the film also examines the emptiness of such a non-commital lifestyle- the unbearable lightness. If this all sounds very somber, ULOB is also one of the sexiest films you will ever see, and one of the few intelligent studies of sex in cinema. More surprisingly, it is a heartbreaking romance.

I 'think' Bretton is setting us up for a story about Claire and her own love life, but I don't think it'd be very interesting based upon her character in this book. The story contained a lot of in-fighting between family members, lots of bad blood between relations and future relations, and turned a great character (Kelly O'Malley) into a bad one for the sake of the storyline.

From the descriptions and glowing reviews, I figured I should have loved it. I even read it while I was traveling up the US/Canadian west coast, and I grew up familiar with many of the areas mentioned in the book. In spite of all that, I didn't like it at all. For one thing, it's full of these obscure Buddhist terms and concepts, and although religion is sort of a hobby of mine, I didn't know enough to make sense of all the boddishatva-dropping, and the writing wasn't good enough to make up for that.

It's about Kerouac's search for a simple life and Zen Buddhism. The premise sounds interesting enough, but for me it just didn't have anything to offer.I once described Kerouac's classic On The Road as being like an episode of Seinfeld, a show about nothing. Despite the rather non complimentary comparison I thought that novel was very good and I highly recommended it.Dharma Bums was another meandering novel where nothing really happens.

You can get some info on the song/artist, hear some clips, and if you're so-inclined, you can buy the complete song from Sony via download.

Diehard Eddie Fisher fans will probably want both! First, there is the very good (even though it's currently out of print) CD entitled ""Songs for Christmas"" by Eddie Fisher which has two bonus tracks by Frankie Laine. Second, there is the CD that contains the music from three of Eddie's record albums entitled ""Eddie Fisher Sings;"" ""I'm in the Mood for Love"" and ""Christmas with Eddie Fisher.""

After reading all these excellent reviews about the Altitude IV, I purchased a pair with high expectations. However, my first pair had a defect in the left shoe.

Several aspects are covered, such as training, family support(or the lack of it), competition, injuries, and eating disorders. This is certainly long enough(almost two hours), but my only criticism is that in many of the interviews we see the person seated in a chair for almost the entire segment, instead of having them talk over scenes of dancing.

negative,"You Can Never Have Enough Anti-War Songs...: Chumbawamba is an underground British band that has been around for almost 20 years. They had a stroke of surprising luck in 1997 with the infectious dance/sports anthem Tubthumper. However, that song is not a good representation of their sound. Musically they remind somewhat of Scissors Sisters with a little Frankie Goes to Hollywood or maybe a rebellious Abba with a few shots of whiskey in them. Their lyrics are very political in a very abstract way and written for a British audience at that. The CD is also filled with many anarchist spoken-word soundbites. I checked out their very active website and they are selling t-shirts with George Bush's face above the label TERRORIST and the back of the shirt says ""You Can Never Have Enough Anti-War Songs"".

I then printed some wallet size pictures of my son from his school picture they also came out wonderful. I am very pleased with this printer.

When I started the book, I planned to read the entire series. I was so completely let down that I don't know if I'll ever read Asimov again. Foundation simply failed to ignite any spark in my imagination. The characters are poorly developed, largely because of the huge leaps in time throughout the book. In addition, the inability of a person writing sci-fi -- which by its nature looks to the future -- to envision any role for women in that future is deplorable. I thought Asimov's work trite, boring, and completely lacking in the sort of foresight that makes books by authors like William Gibson and Tad Williams so amazingly captivating.

Yes I understand that it's science fiction, but I find it strains credulity to think that the characters were able to invent a religion worlds-spanning religion in 30 years. It also didn't seem very likely that a 12,000-year-old empire would so quickly crumble into the stone age (I'm exaggerating slightly).

negative,"Good? You bet. Great? Not sure ...: I found the politics of this novel interesting enough to disregard the dated scientific references. Seldon and his science was fascinating to behold, and the plot was masterful. What concerned me was (dare I say it?) the fairly amateurish use of dialogue tags and the fact that each character seemed pretty much to speak with the same voice. Asimov wrote this as one of those authors who are at pains not to repeat 'he said'. So it must be a new tag each time, no matter how ridiculous, often paired with an adverb that makes you cringe: ('spluttered angrily', 'cried sternly', 'mumbled grumpily', so on.) Sad this very basic trick of writing lets down passages of vivid description and intriguing plot.Also, some things seemed implausible to me, such as: how was the foundation, which exported its technology across the galaxy, able to keep its technology secret?Nonetheless, this is a series every sci-fi fan has to read - its attributes outweigh its faults by a fair margin.",good bet great sure found polit novel interest enough disregard date scientif refer seldon scienc fascin behold plot master concern dare say fair amateurish use dialogu tag fact charact seem pretti much speak voic asimov wrote one author pain repeat said must new tag time matter ridicul often pair adverb make cring splutter angrili cri stern mumbl grumpili sad basic trick write let passag vivid descript intrigu plotalso thing seem implaus foundat export technolog across galaxi abl keep technolog secretnonetheless seri everi scifi fan read attribut outweigh fault fair margin,0.9735,4
positive,"Not A Great Book By Any Means, But Well Written: Political space tales aren't really my thing, but I must say that, politics aside, I was astonished that Asimov was so young when he wrote this. Few writers can write such good prose before middle-age. The story itself is rather mundane for a true sci-fi enthusiast. You'll not find any great discoveries by astronaut explorers or the like, but what it does do, it does well. His treatment of religion is silly though, and like most atheist writers, it's not very well thought out. I've not read anything else by him, but one hopes his later novels were better developed in that area.

No, I can't prove that there could actually be a Mule, but why waste your time trying to? The Mule is probably one of the best literary constructs to grace the world of science fiction, one that isn't decked out in gadgets and laser beams.

This lets Asimov flesh out the stories more, adding detail and plot intricacies. The first story, The Big and The Little, is not one of the series' strongest. However, the second story, The Mule, is the masterpiece of the series. It tells of a muntant, The Mule, who falls outside the scope of Hari Seldon's psychohistory as one supremely powerful individual. The story is told in almost detective story fashion similar to the first two Robot novels. It's quite as suspenseful and involving as Asimov at his best and one of his utmost classics. There's quite a lot of plot tangling and twists, and the ending is a shocker. It's not quite a cliffhanger but will definitely make you want to read the next book, which is great also.

positive,"Going deeper: I read this book after coming blind to the foundation books - I've never read Asimov in a novel before. I've noted how Asimov, when writing the books, was very much a part of his time. When a character doesn't smoke, it is a character trait to point out where everyone else smokes by course. Also, sexism is taken for granted, and when a female character assumes to be treated with equal rights it is a place for comment. I had hoped that we would have found better ways to get high and allowed more equality that far into the future, but I suppose smoke 'em if you got 'em.Anyways, I like this book better than the previous one because there are characters that you can root for and unexpected jerks in the plot-line and a more linear narrative based on the fact that a lot of the exposition is out of the way from the first book.

The characters don't seem to really reach me the way they should, but one has to bear in mind that this book is actually a collection of shorter stories published in serial format, and the writer could not be bothered too much with deep character development.

The landlord, Mr. Roper, won't allow a man to live with two women. The solution? Tell him Jack pitches for the other team. The show is heavy on farce (A light dramatic work in which highly improbable plot situations, exaggerated characters, and often slapstick elements are used for humorous effect) and John Ritter's Jack is the highlight with his physical comedy.

I also thought that it was going to be more of a musical, but there was very little singing, so I was disappointed in that.

I don't think that's a good message for kids, even if the methods used are done by fairy godmothers.

There seem to be at least three themes or storylines in here struggling to get out. One seems to be a reasonably good alternative-history novel based on the idea that the pirate subculture of the 1700s might have formed a revolutionary constitutional regime. Unfortunately, this quickly becomes mixed up with maundering about certain ancient ""cities of the red night"" and a very great deal of homosexual imagery and fantasy.

No need to deflate or remove flock from the area, but you have to press down carefully and firmly.2) An internal seam will pop (usually in the middle) and create a huge bubble in the center.

Self-promotion is hard to pull off, and for me the author did not successfully pull it off. Reading this book was similar to being on the receiving end of a self-absorbed bore's monologue at a cocktail party, absent the cocktails and the party.The book is less about Claude Harmon, Sr. and more about Butch Harmon, Jr. and how he ""got his life together.""

negative,stupid student review by gabriel c: Romeo and Juliet is a story about to lovers that meet at first sight. The biggest problem they have together is that both of the families have been fighting and hate each other since they both have been born. It all started when Romeo been depressed ever day moping around and feeling sad all of the time because he loved Rosaline and she did not love him back. So one day Romeos cousin told him about this party and that Rosaline would be there so they left and Romeo saw Juliet there and followed her to her house and both exchanged thoughts about each other and decided that they will get married but secretly. So they had to come up with a plan to pretend that Juliet was died so the can get married and the planned failed and they both ended up killing themselves.

It makes it difficult to follow the story because Shakespeare plays with words and even invented some expressions.We like a few characters like Mercutio, because of his sexual jokes and language. Another character that we enjoyed was The Nurse, because of her fun-loving personality. The dirty sexual humor was very unexpected and, very funny.We found strange that the prohibited love of Romeo and Juliet was not because one family was in a poor social position, but because the two families fight for their own power. We also liked its end, when Romeo and Juliet died.

positive,"A Fine Work: Romeo and Juliet is the first Shakespearean play I have read. I thought it was very good. It didn't have a complicated plot like other Shakespearean plays allegedly have. The language, of course, is great. I would also recommend buying this edition of the book if any, because old and archaic words and phrases are translated on every other page (this is a huge help). Shakespeare offers some good comic relief (watch for several double entendres) throughout the play which moderated the level of lament. This play shows the chaos that can result when people let their emotions overcome reason, and also what can result when you only look short term and move with so much ""haste"". After finishing the play, I realized that there were indeed only a couple of totally reasonable characters, but I'll leave that to you.

Although Doresse is a Christian proponent with a thinly veiled hostility to Gnostic tradition, he provides a wealth of reference material and, like Kurt Rudolph, indicates a possible interaction with Gnostic beliefs and Paganism--particularly in Alexandria, the motherland of Gnostic Paganism.

The action starts out slowly enough as the crew begin their journey but it builds speed with a nice deliberate pace. The scope and depth of the book accelerate inevitably and irresistibly along with the central characters themselves. One of my favorite aspects of the book is that it is paced very much like climbing a mountain. Just when you reach what appears to be the peak, you realize there is even more to come, beyond what you had previously imagined.The physical description of the effects of close-to-light travel is also quite enjoyable and is one of the features one would expect from Reynolds, as a former scientist and a noted hard-sci-fi writer.

However, in my opinion the design is flawed and the quality of the toy, in general is very poor. The elevator never worked properly because, after awhile, the height of the toy causes it to sag one way or another and the elevator would get stuck.

negative,"JUNK - don't waste your money or time!: My company bought this scanner about a year and a half ago. We have 10 - 15 people who use it intermittently. It does not see heavy use. From the beginning we've had trouble with it jamming and feeding multiple pages. The cover to open it is very hard to snap open, and it won't recover from a jam without us turning off the scanner and rebooting the computer. I discovered that if I change the automatic document feeder pad assembly every 3 months or so, which I should not have to do, it helps the jamming and misfeed issue. Recently I went to order these pads, which were $20.00 apiece, and I couldn't find them on Xerox's website.

I have had several issues with using OmniPage, Readris, and Microsoft Scanning software bundled with Windows. While image quality is good, especially considering the speed of the ADF, the ADF gets jammed during almost every scan with these programs.I strongly recommend that if you have purchased this scanner, use Adobe Acrobat 6 or later. I am using 6.0 Professional and it works like a charm. The file size is extremely manageable (300K for 15 pages) and is quite readable.If you have not purchased this scanner, DON'T. While I don't have any recommendations for other models or brands, I will suggest strongly that you avoid this one.

Our special friends at Creative gave this thing good sound quality, great features, long battery life, and an unbeatable price. The catch is it's built like a piece of crap. It lasted about 1 1/2 weeks. I didn't abuse it, I charged it every day, but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out. I tried re-setting it, I tried just about every pair of headphones in my house (10 pairs), and nothing worked. So I contacted customer service at Creative, but they said, ""If the product seems broken, we cannot help,"" or something to that effect. Wow. Don't get me wrong, the thing was like heaven for about a week. If you want a quality mp3 player, splurge on an ipod.

It also creates playlists on the go for you (combining tracks by the same Artist, the same album, or same genre) for easy playback retrieval.The software that it comes with, Creative MediaSource, is great also, however may be a little complicated for new computer users. It lets you edit all track information (Artist, genre, album, track #) regardless of what ID3 tags were used when recording.Also do I need to remind you of the removable battery. Poor iPod users have to shell out almost $100 to get their battery serviced/replaced when its dead. Also you can store, data files, video files, etc. on the Zen Xtra (it's a portable hard drive also)The only negative is the buttons on the case are oddly positioned.Overall I don't recommend this item for newbies.

Yeah, everyone is playing the notes very nicely, but these are merely rote and exceedingly pallid, mainly instrumental verions of the originals, which on the first album are full of much more passion and spontaneity.

positive,"Flawed but interesting fiction on Russian America: I can't help but think this book would have been far better as a non-fiction piece. The characters are not really that absorbing, and I feel that the narrator has much more to say about the experience of kayaking or canoeing the Northwest Coast from Sitka to Oregon than the fiction format allows him to. The description of the sea and land is really amazing and makes it absolutely worth reading. However, I have a bit of sympathy for the reviewer who said it was boring because the plot is not as gripping as a summary would suggest (4 men escape from Novo-Arkhangelsk, now Sitka, in order to eventually return to Sweden). It is a man against nature story, but I suppose I found the nature part much more interesting than the men.A non-fiction reflection retracing this journey interwoven with the author's own thoughts probably would have been much more gripping.Still, it is worth reading nonetheless.",flaw interest fiction russian america cant help think book would far better nonfict piec charact realli absorb feel narrat much say experi kayak cano northwest coast sitka oregon fiction format allow descript sea land realli amaz make absolut worth read howev bit sympathi review said bore plot grip summari would suggest 4 men escap novoarkhangelsk sitka order eventu return sweden man natur stori suppos found natur part much interest mena nonfict reflect retrac journey interwoven author thought probabl would much grippingstil worth read nonetheless,0.9981,-1

With a little effort, I was finally able to insert the earphone, but could not get any sound.I contacted Sandisk and was very disappointed with their response.

That is to say, Bugliosi is evidently proud (rightfully so) of his accomplishment as the lead prosecutor on the case. And he pretty much makes mincemeat out the intellect of the LAPD and the defense attorneys involved. But like any good prosecutor (and Bugliosi is most certainly that) he has quite a bit of evidence to back his charges of ineptitude. If I were Kanarek, or a Tate detective, I'd be pretty embarrassed knowing this book is an all-time bestseller.But who are we kidding, this is the definitive book on Tate-Labianca. A truly fantastic read.",sheer mad meticul document yes review correct excel writer detail gruesom kill time fastest 650 page ever read gaurante iton note book might also call vincent bugliosi man brought charl manson live tell say bugliosi evid proud right accomplish lead prosecutor case pretti much make mincemeat intellect lapd defens attorney involv like good prosecutor bugliosi certain quit bit evid back charg ineptitud kanarek tate detect id pretti embarrass know book alltim bestsellerbut kid definit book tatelabianca truli fantast read,0.9995,48
positive,The weirdest plot ever and it's all true.: I remember last year around Halloween I read an article about the best books to read for Halloween. Even the article's author conseded that this was a strange choice (it's not fiction) but had a good point. The first 10 pages of this book are truly terrifying and I guarantee you will be affected. It is also very hard because you can't help but feel desperate for the victims because terror was a part of what these killers meant to put into their last moments of life. And as most who know about this case it was one of the most horrible crime scenes to ever be discovered.,weirdest plot ever true rememb last year around halloween read articl best book read halloween even articl author consed strang choic fiction good point first 10 page book truli terrifi guarante affect also hard cant help feel desper victim terror part killer meant put last moment life know case one horribl crime scene ever discov,0.963,114

positive,"This Book Will Scare The Hell Out Of You: Vincent Bugliosi isn't kidding when he writes on the very first page ""The Story You Are About To Read Will Scare The Hell Out Of You"". Bugliosi somehow finds a way into the sick and distorted mind of Charles Manson, as he was the prosecutor during Manson's trial. He remembers small details from long ago, never moving over to another topic. ""Helter Skelter"" is a great albeit terrifying book.",book scare hell vincent bugliosi isnt kid write first page stori read scare hell bugliosi somehow find way sick distort mind charl manson prosecutor manson trial rememb small detail long ago never move anoth topic helter skelter great albeit terrifi book,0.981,48
